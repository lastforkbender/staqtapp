        # main entry rev9 candidate method; general info gathering for a in-build custom global variables i/o grouped py modules library assembly
        
        # REV9 DEVELOP NOTES: this method does not read, write or make zip files, however should never be called from the PySqTpp_Parser or the PySqTpp_Alpha Staqtapp py modules methods!
            
            
            # REV9 IN-BUILD BEGIN ENTRY METHOD PARAMETERS:
                
                # (1)    <is_slots_encoding=bool>,  applies abstract __slots__ py module class/function programming to the in-build global variables library rev9 decisions, this can effect performance and the overall built size of the library finalized
                
                # (2)    <is_sars_encoding=bool>,  applies global sar variables type/global sar temple variables pointer type programming to finalized library build, see PySqTpp_Alpha or stpp module's sar functions descriptions usage
                
                # (3)    <is_multi_stability=bool>,  applies complete finalized directional error checking within interface/class/functions to class/functions usage inner and/or outer; if False, does not apply it's code writting for more strict type error feedbacks
                
                # (4)    <is_multi_extractable=bool>,  applies approximate global variables data @is_variables_topography_learning, or if False makes choice of indicated performance clauses by any found constants in parameters changes
                       # *****can build bluetooth functional file extension matters//custom normals or customs invertable to sars enabled self-network expressions interconnected e.g. android os*****
                
                # (5)    <is_obfuscated=bool>,  applies obfuscated variables naming to the in-build coding of the custom global variables library, does not obfuscate the finalized callable function names or their parameters
                
                # (6)    <is_content_dependent=bool>,  applies formulation strict observes to global variables data type interactions chosen; a basic read/write functional argument, however does effect overall performance in a finalized library build
                       # *****can build bluetooth functional file extension matters//custom normals or customs invertable to sars enabled self-network expressions interconnected e.g. android os*****
                
                # (7)    <is_static_shifting=bool>,  applies any chosen shifting mechanics to the global variables file type format chosen via static bound declaring in coding builds; can take longer of it's decision build loops but more tighter coding finalized of library builds
                
                # (8)    <is_sorting_tolerate=bool>,  applies & determines position inter-changes to global variables file formats, function direction flowings and read/write mapping of global variables scope communication to outer parameters options made
                
                # (9)    <is_counterintuitive_variables=bool>,  from above almost opposite but not, applies non-traditional means of callable function flows inner to global variables file format overall library builds; can make the function encoding difficult to read
                
                # (10)  <is_superpalindrome_pointers=bool>,  uses superbranching rotational variables mapping to the applied coding in-build resolves, in the global variables file read/write regions of library made; can effect reading performances if using __slots__
                       # *****can build bluetooth functional file extension matters//custom normals or customs invertable to sars enabled self-network expressions interconnected e.g. android os*****
                
                # (11)  <is_variables_length_muting=bool>,  uses strict lock-offs to finalized functions' parameters usages built; the rev9 model determines this scope and can also effect performance timing and can make very unreadable function encodings also
                
                # (12)  <is_variables_topography_learning=bool>,  rev9 model build decision based exclusive only, joins property scopes of any found constants to combine/compress for other file types associated & written for any outer data gathering usage
                       # *****can build bluetooth functional file extension matters//custom normals or customs invertable to sars enabled self-network expressions interconnected e.g. android os*****
                
                # (13)  <global_variables_file_extension: str>,  global variables source file extension to use for the finalized rev9 global variables library build
                
                # (14)  <global_variables_library_name: str>,  overall library name of the global variables read/write library to be built by the rev9 model; rev9 build library model uses this to name on all other files, classes, functions, variables, slots and etc.
                
                # PARAMETERS NOTES: both 13 & 14 method parameters must be of a certain str length and a accepted readable str format for the rev9 global variables library in-build --to-- final py modules make
