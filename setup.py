            Staqtapp 1.2 is an env-var library integrated for many options in env-var
        use and research. All slots attrs programming throughout, featured importable
        functions like stalkvar and joinvars redefine the power of using a vfs system
        for env-var integrations. This library includes unique emphasis in allowing a
        host variables assignments changes with stalkvar function, including searches
        and direct/indirect changes of a stalked env-var or spawned var attached to a
        stalked env-var. Opening up vast recursive options within the vfs file, that
        can also be respawned itself. However is taken a step further... Staqtapp 1.2
        has a custom tree dict type env-var, mv-tree, that has similiar responses as
        a stalked env-var in spawning merged branching and merged key-pairing shifts.

            With Staqtapp 1.2, the option of qubit type simulation programming exist
        by these importable functions: stalkvar, joinvars, changevar, addtree_stx,
        addbranch_stx, getbranch_stx, revar and findvar_stx with property exchanges
        of what env-var is multi-accessed or not via keyvar & lockvar functions. It
        setups implementations of gate splicing across the env-var stacks in multiple
        vfs files if chosen, where merge branch & shift features of a mv-tree usage.
        These features added and tested for the Staqtapp-Koch 2nd version, which is a
        multi-encrypt tor like vfs env-var lib of high level mobile security purposes.
        Though a mv-tree env-var type for this Staqtapp version lacks some of those
        requirements, is still the basic hard coded dict type re-structuring response
        unchanged. The renamevar_stx with stalkvar functional intersections proves it.

            The lambdavar function is most recent added feature to Staqtapp 1.2 lib.
        It works in a cojunction with addvar to recognize a lambda function is being
        added to an vfs tqpt env-var stack. When lambdavar is then called on for that
        env-var entry, Staqtapp builds a custom slots performance py module to run the
        lambda parameterless. Converts all parameters of the lambda to slots attrs. It
        allows lambda functions to be stored & ran this way from any sqtpp vfs files.
        Once the lambda is ran once, then is direct ran without any conversion or edit
        of the module. This not only allows memory reduction cuts for lambda functions
        use but a one module container for any lambda function usage. The lambdalist
        function allows specific param return reads of stored lambdas in a tqpt stack,
        to be used in pairing with the awesome lambdavar function call.
