‚óè Staqtapp 1.2

One of a slots kind env-var library module. Includes all needed env-var uses and exotic ones only found of Staqtapp.

Staqtapp 1.2 uses a vfs system exclusive for env-var keeps and functional interactions.

*This version includes the rev9 feature central to Staqtapp 1, that builds it's own custom env-var libaries with bluetooth integrations of communication for other builds.

(The library is a work in progress and differs greatly from the Koch version of Staqtapp, which is the most secure env-vars library in the world. That version and it's updates are no longer posted for public content.)
