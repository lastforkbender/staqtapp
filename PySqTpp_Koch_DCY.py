# ●■ Staqtapp-Koch Module Name: PySqTpp_Koch_DCY.py


# ● ■  Description of this module's purpose:
    
#       This module makes decoy/dummy vfs directories & files. This is the
#       public version of this feature, contained in this module only. The
#       more secure version of Staqtapp-Koch uses ml and urls for this. Is
#       for protecting the .envfs file upfront; the code is commented here.
#       However the more secure version of this library is not freeware.


# ● ■  Staqtapp-Koch Env-Vars Library Overview:

#       The current project status is critical to implementing security
#       values of env-var use not seen before or done before. In focus
#       of forthcoming advances, this env-var library is being built of
#       a proposed system that forms a basis of complex abstractions to
#       isolate those security values. Whereof any considerations into
#       env-var security that would involve other discrete methods inact
#       to placements of env-var use, those outer models of access or no.
#       This library using fractal based rotational palindrome settings
#       of env-var use and of extreme cut-off for modern ai comprehension
#       if applied correctly as a modular sub-system approach.
