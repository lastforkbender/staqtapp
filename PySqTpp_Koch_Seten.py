# Staqtapp-Koch: Hybrid Env-Vars Lib (https://github.com/lastforkbender/staqtapp)

# Version: 2.01.028

# ●■ Staqtapp-Koch Module Name: PySqTpp_Koch_Seten.py


# ● ■  Description of this module's purpose:
    
#       This module directs all Seten related modules, including types of
#       key sets, total obfuscation+encryption layering of env-vars data.
#       However is disconnected from what random obfuscation was applied;
#       in that attempts of hijacking this module's direction of what ---
#       obfuscation next or previous is extreme entanglement both ways.
#       Also uses sar type variables and sar type pointers, whereof env-
#       vars have no specific name, just a address of random numbers. Of
#       this type addr pointing once compressed, not even the most power-
#       ful quantum computers in the future can sort them correctly again
#       unless both compression table constants known, no invert nesting.
#       (See method extr_load_sar_remap() @ PySqTpp_Alpha.py of Staqtapp)


# ● ■  Staqtapp-Koch Env-Vars Library Overview:

#       The scope of this env-vars system is routine focused upon env-var
#       security via obfuscated addresses inter-connected to env-vars own
#       obfuscation of it's data, using tor like circumstances, procedural
#       generation of env-var keys/spacing and one-way shared descriptors.

#       Having limited made keys outside this env-var system for access of
#       advanced security issue... if chosen of a needed env-vars solution.
#       Of then a email response will be given for a phone number to call,
#       involving a signature and purchase after agreed terms are met, then
#       custom built Staqtapp-Koch full package library for your key sent.
#       Pricing terms for single package is $318 U.S. dollars, however ---
#       is variable to the conditions of use.(This public version does not
#       include those strong fractal-palindrome based security modules.)
